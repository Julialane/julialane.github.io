<h2>My Classes</h2>
    <p> I am a business management major and a freshman, so most of my classes are business introduction classes and general education classes.
        My favorite class is probably my music class. During the class, we listen to different types of music from different time periods, and we
        learn all about textures and different sounds that go in to the songs. My favorite business class though is info tech. I think its really
        interesting because everything that we are learning about right now is what my mom does for work. I'm super excited to learn more about
        business and about the business world. </p>
    <h3> My New Friends</h3>

    <p> This is a picture of my new friends here at school! It is my roomate and two other girls that live in my building. At first when I came to
        Umaine, I was really nervous about making new friends but I am so happy with the friends I made. Each of the friends I have made here, remind
        me of my friends back home, which makes me so happy.</p>
    <h4> What I look forward to?</h4>
    <p>I look forward to learning more about business and my major, meeting more people, going to sporting events, living independently, living in
        Maine and being in college in general. </p>

    <h5>Why I chose Umaine</h5>

    <p> I chose Umaine for many reasons. Im not going to lie, one of the main reasons I chose Umaine was because they gave me the most money
    out of all of the colleges I was accepted to. But I also chose Umaine because I love the area of Maine, I love the community surrounding
    the campus, and I loved the atmosphere of the campus when I came to visit. </p>

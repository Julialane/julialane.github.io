    <p> These are my two best friends, Vicky on the left and Katie on the right. I met both of them my freshman year at Nashoba. The three of us
    had a lot of classes together and we immediatly clicked. We stayed best friends all throughout high school and still talk every single day
    despite being so far from each other. Vicky studies communications at Quinipiac University in Connecticut and Katie studies business at the
        University of Alabama so she is very far. </p>

       <p>My favorite memory of Katie and Vicky is from junior year. They knew that our friend Lincoln had
    wanted to ask me to prom, so Katie and Vicky planned the entire "promposal" without me knowing. Lincoln made a poster, bought flowers and
    came to my hockey game and hid upstairs near the concession stand. At the end of the game they all stood outside the doors so I walked right
    into them as I was getting off of the ice. It meant so much to me, that they helped Lincoln plan the whole thing and that they came to the
       game and got to see me play.</p>

<h2>Freshman at University of Maine. I am a management major in the business school.</h2>

<h3>Some facts about me!</h3>
<p>I am from Lancaster, Massachusetts, a small town in central Mass. I went to Nashoba Regional High school in Bolton, Massachusetts. Nashoba was a regional high school, so the towns of Lancaster, Bolton and Stow all went there. I really liked that it was a regional high school, because I got the chance to meet people from different towns, and one of my best friends throughout high school lived in Bolton, so it is weird to think that if Nashoba wasn't a regional high school, I probably wouldn't have been friends with her. While I was at Nashoba, I played soccer my freshman and sophomore year, and I played softball and ice hockey all four years.<p>

<p> Ice Hockey was definitely my favorite sport and has given me so many opportunities to meet new people, to travel, and to grow as a player and as a person. Nashoba didn't have enough girls to have our own ice hockey team, so we had to join with three other schools in our area, including, Hudson, Marlboro, and Algonquin. As much I loved my friends from Nashoba, it was so much fun being able to meet more friends from surrounding schools. It was also cool, because I had even played with some of the girls before through club teams, or even played against some of them. My freshman year and my senior year were the only two years that we made playoffs. My freshman year, we got out in the first round against the team that ended up winning the state, but my senior year, we did much better. We went into the tournament ranked 13th in the state and we ended up knocking out the 14th seed, the 9th seed and even the 4th seed. We made it all the way to the quarter finals, but ended up losing to the number one seeded team. Despite the loss, it was an amazing last season as a captain and especially as a senior. My freshman year in high school, I was playing for a club team out of Concord, Massachusetts, and we got the opportunity to play a tournament in Toronto, Canada and that same year, we won a national championship in Lansing, Michigan. Originally I had wanted to continue playing hockey in college but the older I got, the more I began to realize how much of a committment it would be to play at the collegiate level. I knew I would miss the sport tremendously, but I also wanted to give myself a chance to be able to do things that I hadn't had the time to do because I was always busy with hockey, like volunteering, traveling without playing hcokey, and joining different clubs.</p>

<p>These are my parents Patti and Kevin. My mom is a graphic designer and my dad is a life skills teacher at a high school near my home town. My mom likes going shopping and doing a lot of other girly things with me but my dad has always been
    my hockey coach and has taught me how to play all the sports I grew up playing. </p>

<p>These are my siblings Connor and Tori. Connor is 20 years old and he is working at a pizza place and a skateboard camp right now, trying to
figure out what he wants to do for a permanent job. Tori is only 15 years old, and she is a sophomore at the same high school that I graduated
from. She plays soccer and basketball. </p>

<p>This one of the most important members of the Lane family, his name is Bailey. Bailey is a beagle-huskey mix, who loves sitting on the couch,
playing in the snow, and eating anything and everything possible. We got Bailey when I was in the third grade and he will be turning eleven this
    march, on Saint Patrick's Day!</p>

<p> We also have four cats whose names are, Minnie, Goofy, Tux, and Oliver. Minnie is crazy, Goofy is very big and tends to act like a dog, tux
is the best cuddler and she is super fluffy, and Oliver is very shy but he is my favorite. </p>
